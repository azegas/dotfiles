** Why I am using emacs

- I take notes in it
- I write code in it
- I plan time in it
- I run terminal in it
- I write and publish my blog with it
- I can write journal in it
- I basically live in it when I am at the computer
- I like improving my tools and workflow, emacs allows that
- Emacs is the most flexible and configurable editor I know

** Emacs usage/config history

I put this at the end, since this info is not really crucial for the configuration.

*** [2024-05-27 Mon] Cam back to Emacs

I have been working with VsCode at work and at home for the last 3-4 months. It
seemed too much time consuming to keep my notes up to date on all
environments(wanted to have something as easy as onedrive for my notes. One
place, can open everywhere, even at work).

Also wanted to have my work's environment to be the same as my colleagues, so
we could launch and debug things easier.

------

Been writing some docs today at home, in vscode, in markdown.. and realized
that man.. this is just sooo painful. Also saw Torstein's webpage, saw blog
posts about emacs.. and then realized that I regred switching to VSCode. It is
just so much more pleasing to be in Emacs and it is kind of my thing...

About notes - they did not seem like a factor because of which I would not use
emacs again. At work I would barely open my dev notes and when I do - does not
matter in what matter they are written, they are helpful. So if it's in org - it's in org.

At work I might continue using VSCode, just because everyone there does it and
it's a bit tricky to setup emacs there to run on nixos(did it once, can do it
again).

*** [2023-12-05 Tue] Back to one single init.org file for configuration

While driving from work I listened to [[https://github.com/freetonik/emacscast.org][emacascast]] podcast (episode 2)and
realized how great the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate programming]] is and how well it suites the emacs
config file. Today I switched back to using one .org file with all the
configurations instead of many small .el files.

*** [2023-11-28 Tue] Emacs for note taking

Decided to use emacs for note taking primarily. I rarely come to emacs
to write code. All these AI tools and so on.. Staying in other editors
instead. And if I come to emacs to code, I spend quite a while editing
the setup and yeah..

So, this emacs configuration is aimed to creating a "second brain",
for note keeping/taking/searching etc.

For that the code package is Denote. [[https://github.com/arvydasg/.emacs.d/commit/efb3b0f28b64a2dee7cca703ff301ea56f55921f][efb3b0f]] commit is the essential
one, where most modifications have happened.

Notes from that commint that summarize this chapter:
- consult package is amazing
- super nice to write notes with denote. Like the structure
- cleared up some clutter from the emacs config, replaced/removed lots
  of packages
- vertico + orderless for nice search mechanism
- project.el instead of projectile
- New theme

*** [2023-06-05 Mon] Lots of refactoring

New laptop, new setup ONCE Again. This time on Windows and WSL.

Have a lof of directories that have to be changed all the time I
switch machines, so decided to put all of those directories in one
place so it's easy to configure.

*** [2023-03-18 Sat] One org mode file for all configuration

Branch copied from "230318-Org-file-in-project-folder".

Decided to make .org file to act as my init file. Better for
documenting processes and storing shortcuts.. now I have three places
for that. One for init(config), one for shortcuts one for
documentation of emacs processes.

In the future it might be problem with windows stuff, but will see
then.

*** [2023-01-08 Sun] No init.org.
With it the config loads slower and it's not as easy to turn off
packages quickly. With my setup, I just uncomment the code and the
package is ignrod upon next load.

In case I want to load org file as my init.el, I can do it by placing
init.org file in my .emacs.d

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  (package-initialize)
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org")
#+end_src

*** [2023-01-06 Fri] Daemon mode

Found out about emacs daemon mode. It makes emacs
instances load instantaneously. Amazing.

Add these to .bashrc for easy launch/use/kill:

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  alias ed='emacs --daemon'
  alias e='emacsclient -c -n'
  alias ek='emacsclient -e "(kill-emacs)"'
#+end_src

*** [2023-01-06 Fri] Using emacs with org mode at work

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1043g41/help_me_use_emacs_with_org_mode_at_work/][Using emacs with org mode at work]].
Finally decided to have work org files at work and personal at home.
Better work and life balance in this way. Emacs at work windows
computer will run on WSL with [[https://opticos.github.io/gwsl/][GWSL]] for a GUI.

*** [2022-12-27 Tue] Overwhelmed

I am feeling little bit overwhelmed with my workflow
with emacs to track my daily tasks and projects at home and at work.

All was fine until I discovered that I can use emacs at work(finally).
Now the struggle is with Dropbox, keeping only my work files at work,
but also seeing them at home..

Then also the agenda views, capture templates, refiling, one big org
file or many small org files, tags, categories, archiving and so on.
The more I tinker with it the more lost and confused I become.

Each time configuring the method requires me restructuring the
notes...

This is the attempt where I try to implement this:

https://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/remember.html

https://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/mydotemacs.txt

https://lifehacker.com/the-weekly-review-how-one-hour-can-save-you-a-week-s-w-5908816

Wish me luck.

I will simplify it as much as possible, then use it with ease and
enjoyment. I know it.

** How to use this config

This is an Emacs configuration file written in [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]]. It is an attempt to
keep my =~/.emacs.d= tidy, but still be able to keep it all in one file. I
aim to briefly explain all my configurations as I go along!

I would not recommend using this configuration /as-is/, because it probably
contains a lot you don't really need. I do, however, hope people find some
golden nuggets that they can smuggle into their own configs.

If you really do want to try this config out, this is how I'd go about it:

Backup your old =~/.emacs.d= (if necessary).

#+begin_src sh :tangle no
  mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d-bak
#+end_src

Backup your old =~/.emacs=-file (if necessary).

#+begin_src sh :tangle no
  mv ~/.emacs ~/.emacs-bak
#+end_src

Clone the repo.

#+begin_src sh :tangle no
  git clone https://github.com/arvydasg/.emacs.d
#+end_src

On first run it should install a bunch of packages (this might take a while),
and you might have to restart your Emacs the first time. If you experience
bugs, please let me know!

** Minimal config

If for any reason you might want to start the emacs config with minimal
settings, there is =test-config.el= in the current directory as well.

We can use it to start another(or new) emacs session by running such command in
the terminal while in =.emacs.d= directory.

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  emacs -q -l test-config.el
#+end_src

* Tangling
** What is tangling, literate programming, org-babel

All changes to the configuration should be done in =init.org=, *not* in
=init.el=. Any changes in the =init.el= will be OVERWRITTEN(due to the script
below) by saving =init.org=. The =init.el= in this repo should not be tracked
by git, and is replaced the first time Emacs is started (assuming it has been
renamed to =~/.emacs.d=).

Emacs can't load =.org=-files directly, but =org-mode= provides functions to
EXTRACT the code blocks(begin_src) and write them to a file. There are multiple
ways of handling this; like suggested by [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3143/can-i-use-org-mode-to-structure-my-emacs-or-other-el-configuration-file][this StackOverflow post]].

When this configuration is loaded for the first time, the ~init.el~ is the
file that is loaded. It looks like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ;; This file replaces itself with the actual configuration at first run.

  ;; We can't tangle without org!
  (require 'org)
  (require 'org-babel)
  ;; Open the configuration
  (find-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org"))
  ;; tangle it
  (org-babel-tangle)
  ;; load it
  (load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))
  ;; finally byte-compile it
  (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))
#+end_src

It tangles the org-file, so that this file is overwritten with the actual
configuration.

We set :tangle yes to all the source blocks(at the very top of .org file), so
all source blocks get tangled by default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  #+BABEL: :cache yes
  #+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes
  #+STARTUP: overview
#+end_src

There is no reason to track the =init.el= that is generated; by running the
following command =git= will not bother tracking it:

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  git update-index --assume-unchanged init.el
#+end_src

If one wishes to make changes to the repo-version of init.el start tracking again with:

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged init.el
#+end_src

** Lexical binding, garbage collection

Lexical scoping for the init-file is needed, it can be specified in the header.
Make startup faster by reducing the frequency of garbage collection. The
default is 800 kilobytes. Measured in bytes. These are the first lines of the
actual configuration.

A common optimization is to temporarily disable garbage collection during
initialization. Here, we set the ~gc-cons-threshold~ to a ridiculously large
number, and restore the default value after initialization.

Enabling lexical scoping with lexical-binding: t in your Emacs init-file can
provide advantages such as better encapsulation, avoiding accidental variable
modifications, and clearer code behavior by ensuring that variables are scoped
as intended.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
  ;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  Measured in bytes.
  (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1000 1000))
#+end_src

** Automatically tangle init.org and recompile the init.el file

The =init.el= should (after the first run) mirror the source blocks in the
=init.org=. We can use =C-c C-v t= to run =org-babel-tangle=, which extracts
the code blocks from the current file into a source-specific file (in this
case a =.el=-file).

To avoid doing this each time a change is made we can add a function
to the =after-save-hook= ensuring to always tangle and byte-compile
the =org=-document after changes. Open *Compile-Log* buffer to see
if your compilation has been successfull. Great for tracking if you
have broke something with your configuration.

Absolute path to emacs dir
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ag/emacs-dir "~/.emacs.d")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun tangle-init ()
    "If the current buffer is init.org, the code blocks are tangled,
       and the tangled file is compiled."
    (when (equal (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))
                 "init.org")
      ;; Avoid running hooks when tangling.
      (let ((prog-mode-hook nil))
        (org-babel-tangle)
        (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el")))))

  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'tangle-init)
#+end_src

** Turn off errors at the beginning of emacs launch? Native compilation.

Due to emacs 29 and probably because of this tangling thing, with each Emacs
launch I used to suffer seeing lots of warning messages. Emacs worked just
fine, but all these warnings each time.. Was watching this video -
https://www.youtube.com/live/9zwNH2Orw8s?si=4XK5e1pC_DsCisHg&t=2351 at 39:10 and saw a
fix below. Now it's in my config also.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors nil)
#+end_src

* Startup performance

Make startup faster by reducing the frequency of garbage collection and then
use a hook to measure Emacs startup time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Profile emacs startup
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
      (lambda ()
        (message "*** Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections."
           (format "%.2f seconds"
             (float-time
        (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time)))
           gcs-done)))
#+end_src

To check what made emacs load so long and identify the bottle necks, we cna use
function and set it to t. After each emacs launch we can then do =M-x
use-package-report= to check the report.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-compute-statistics t)
#+end_src

* Installation of packages

John Wiegley's extremely popular [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] was included in [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-12/msg00261.html][Emacs 29]]. It
provides a powerful macro for isolating package configuration.

Install use-package if it's not already installed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'use-package)
  ;; always add :ensure t to each package. I like to better add the :ensure t myself
  ;; (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src

Packages can be fetched from different mirrors, [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/][melpa]] is the largest archive
and is well maintained.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-archives
        '(("GNU ELPA"     . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
          ("MELPA Stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/")
          ("MELPA"        . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
        package-archive-priorities
        '(("GNU ELPA"     . 10)
          ("MELPA"        . 5)
          ("MELPA Stable" . 0)))
#+end_src

* General tweaks

** Jump to my main config file.

Putting this at the top of the config to guarantee
that I will always have this keybinding available if stuff breaks futher on in
the config.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ag/find-init.org nil
    (interactive)
    (find-file (concat ag/emacs-dir "/init.org")))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x <C-backspace>") 'ag/find-init.org)
#+end_src

** Jump to my NixOS configuration file

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ag/find-nix-configuration nil
    (interactive)
    (find-file "/etc/nixos/configuration.nix"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-<home>") 'ag/find-nix-configuration)
#+end_src

** Set utf-8 as preferred coding system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+end_src

** unbind c-z

I am tired of clicking C-z by accident and freezing my pane.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
#+end_src

** Set some default variables

We can set variables to whatever value we’d like using setq.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq make-backup-files nil       ; Stop creating backup~ files
        auto-save-default nil             ; Stop creating #autosave# files
        inhibit-startup-screen t          ; No splash screen please
        initial-scratch-message nil       ; Clean scratch buffer
        kill-whole-line t                 ; C-k kills line including its newline
        ring-bell-function 'ignore        ; Quiet
        scroll-margin 1                   ; Space between cursor and top/bottom
        show-paren-delay 0
        sentence-end-double-space nil     ; No double space
        confirm-kill-emacs 'y-or-n-p      ; y and n instead of yes and no when quitting
        read-extended-command-predicate #'command-completion-default-include-p ; Hide M-x commands which does not work in the current buffer.
        )
#+end_src

** Set buffer-local variables?

Some variables are buffer-local, so changing them using setq will only change
them in a single buffer. Using setq-default we change the buffer-local
variable’s default value.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
   fill-column 79                   ;Maximum line width
   ;; auto-fill-function 'do-auto-fill ;Auto-fill-mode everywhere
   calendar-week-start-day 1        ;self explanatory
   )
#+end_src

** Spell checking with flyspell

“Flyspell enables on-the-fly spell checking in Emacs by the means of a minor
mode. It is called Flyspell. This facility is hardly intrusive. It requires no
help. Flyspell highlights incorrect words as soon as they are completed or as
soon as the TextCursor hits a new word.”

Docs - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell. Make sure you have =ispell=
installed on your system.

Here is an example to enable it for text-mode, and disable it for log-edit-mode
and change-log-mode. These two are derived from text-mode, and thus enabling
flyspell-mode for text-mode also enables it for these two. An alternative
solution would be the writing of a flyspell-mode-predicate such that symbols
are ignored by flyspell.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1))))
  (dolist (hook '(change-log-mode-hook log-edit-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode -1))))
#+end_src

** y-or-n-p

Answering yes and no to each question from Emacs can be tedious, a single y or
n will suffice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+end_src

** Autosave stuff

To avoid file system clutter we put all auto saved files in a single directory.
( have not had a chance to use this, keeping anyway..)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar emacs-autosave-directory
    (concat user-emacs-directory "autosaves/")
    "This variable dictates where to put auto saves. It is set to a
    directory called autosaves located wherever your .emacs.d/ is
    located.")

  ;; Sets all files to be backed up and auto saved in a single directory.
  (setq backup-directory-alist
        `((".*" . ,emacs-autosave-directory))
        auto-save-file-name-transforms
        `((".*" ,emacs-autosave-directory t)))
#+end_src

** Clean up all the whitespace in the buffer on buffer save

Sounds nice, but VERY dangerous if you open a file that has never been opened
in emacs and this whitespace-cleanup is ran - the whole file will get changed.
Probably better to turn off when working in a team with someone else.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'whitespace-cleanup)
#+end_src

** Auto fill fix

Auto Fill mode breaks lines automatically at the appropriate places whenever
lines get longer than the desired width. [2023-12-21 Thu] turning this feature
off for a sec. Not good when you have long command line and emacs automatically
wraps it
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+end_src

** Unfill region

[2022-04-05 Tue] Un-fill region. Used it when putting text content to a website
and emacs text wrapping at 79 or 80 characters is not appropriate.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ag/unfill-region (beg end)
    "Unfill the region, joining text paragraphs into a single
      logical line.  This is useful, e.g., for use with
      `visual-line-mode'."
    (interactive "*r")
    (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
      (fill-region beg end)))

  (define-key global-map "\C-\M-Q" 'ag/unfill-region)
#+end_src

** Duplicate current line or region

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun duplicate-current-line-or-region (arg)
    "Duplicates the current line or region ARG times.
  If there's no region, the current line will be duplicated. However, if
  there's a region, all lines that region covers will be duplicated."
    (interactive "p")
    (let (beg end (origin (point)))
      (if (and mark-active (> (point) (mark)))
          (exchange-point-and-mark))
      (setq beg (line-beginning-position))
      (if mark-active
          (exchange-point-and-mark))
      (setq end (line-end-position))
      (let ((region (buffer-substring-no-properties beg end)))
        (dotimes (_ arg)
          (goto-char end)
          (newline)
          (insert region)
          (setq end (point)))
        (goto-char (+ origin (* (length region) arg) arg)))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-c") 'duplicate-current-line-or-region)
#+end_src

* Customize-group

Run =M-x customize-group RET package-name RET= to see or set the possible
variables of particular package.

* Create custom bindings map

Inspired by [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/683425/globally-override-key-binding-in-emacs][this StackOverflow post]] I keep a =custom-bindings-map= that holds
all my custom bindings. This map can be activated by toggling a simple
=minor-mode= that does nothing more than activating the map. This inhibits
other =major-modes= to override these bindings.

Basically instead of using the default key-bindings that come with the
packages, I override the default keybindings globally.

M-x cusom-bindings-map to preview all the bindings in one place.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar ag/custom-bindings-map (make-keymap)
    "A keymap for custom bindings.")
#+end_src

* Packages
** Visuals

*** Declutter

First off, let’s declutter. Remove clickies to give a nice and clean look.
Also, the cursor can relax.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (dolist (mode
           '(tool-bar-mode                ; No toolbars, more room for text

This setting tells Emacs to consider all themes as safe and eliminates the
prompt for confirmation on whether to load and trust a theme with Lisp code.
With this configuration, Emacs will automatically trust and load themes without
asking for confirmation each time you start Emacs.

*** Mode line

**** Custom mode line

Will create my own modeline following [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf_DLPIA9Cs&ab_channel=ProtesilaosStavrou][this]] excellent Protesilaos Stravrou
guide.

***** How it works

First of all I have to mention that I will use =setq-default= instead of
=setq=. Setq-default does the change for ALL the buffers, setq - only for the
current buffer.

Can simply try it out by evaluating this piece of code when you have two
different windows open side by side:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq mode-line-format nil)
#+end_src

Run this command do revert the change in the current buffer/window:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (kill-local-variable 'mode-line-format)
#+end_src

now run this command when you have two buffer windows open, mode line will
dissapear in both:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq-default mode-line-format nil)
#+end_src

So here is my cusom mode line example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq-default mode-line-format
                '("%e"
                  (:eval
                   (format "BUFFER: %s"
                           (propertize (buffer-name) 'face 'success)))
                  "   "
                  (:eval
                   (format "MODE: %s"
                           (propertize (symbol-name major-mode) 'face 'bold)))
                  ))
#+end_src

***** The actual custom modeline

Mainly copied from - https://github.com/terlar/emacs-config

Define a variable to conveniently access only the major mode part of
mode-line-modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar mode-line-major-mode
    `(:propertize ("" mode-name)
                  help-echo "Major mode\n\
  mouse-1: Display major mode menu\n\
  mouse-2: Show help for major mode\n\
  mouse-3: Toggle minor modes"
                  mouse-face mode-line-highlight
                  local-map ,mode-line-major-mode-keymap))
#+end_src

Define custom faces(colors). See all colors available with M-x list-colors-display.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Define a face for the filename part with a different color
  (defface mode-line-filename-face
    '((t (:foreground "gold2")))
    "Face for the filename part of the mode line.")
#+end_src

Configure the order and components of the mode line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default mode-line-format
                '("%e" mode-line-front-space
                  mode-line-misc-info
                  (vc-mode vc-mode)
                  "  "
                  mode-line-modified
                  mode-line-remote
                  "  "
                  (:eval (propertize (concat (abbreviate-file-name default-directory)(buffer-name))
                                     'face 'mode-line-filename-face))
                  ;; mode-line-buffer-identification ;only shows the filename
                  "  "
                  mode-line-position
                  (:eval
                   (mode-line-right))
                  mode-line-end-spaces))
#+end_src

Setup the right aligned mode line and helper functions to display it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar mode-line-right-format nil
    "The mode line to display on the right side.")

  (defun mode-line-right ()
    "Render the `mode-line-right-format'."
    (let ((formatted-line (format-mode-line mode-line-right-format)))
      (list
       (propertize
        " "
        'display
        `(space :align-to (- right
                             (+ ,(string-width formatted-line) right-fringe right-margin))))
       formatted-line)))
#+end_src

Move default components to the right side of the mode line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq mode-line-right-format
        (list '(:eval mode-line-mule-info)
              "  "
              mode-line-major-mode))
#+end_src

Add position information including column and line number but skip the
percentage.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq mode-line-position-column-line-format '(" L%l:C%C"))
  (setq mode-line-percent-position nil)
  (column-number-mode 1)

this out. No more 4 or so windows open at the same time :) Should be able to handle that.

** Modes

Here are a list of modes(that come by default with Emacs) that I prefer to
enable by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (dolist (mode
           '(abbrev-mode                  ; E.g. sopl -> System.out.println
             delete-selection-mode        ; Replace selected text
             dirtrack-mode                ; directory tracking in *shell*
             global-so-long-mode          ; Mitigate performance for long lines
             recentf-mode                 ; Recently opened files
             winner-mode                  ; ctrl+c+left/right redoes/undoes the window layouts
             ))
    (funcall mode 1))
#+end_src

** EditorConfig

Using [[https://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] is a must when collaborating with others. It is also a way
of having multiple tools that want to format your buffer to agree (e.g. both
the language's Emacs mode and some external formatter/prettifier).

#+begin_quote
at work where I'm dev lead, I added an .editorconfig to all our projects to
enforce some basic style consistency. I'm the only full-time Emacs user, and
everyone else uses VS Code, but we now have the same basic indentation style
per project, instead of requiring each dev to self-regulate.

Works well for us, and nobody tinkers with the .editorconfig because, well, I
would never approve that PR heheh.
#+end_quote

We must create .editorconfig file in each project directory and specify
parameters in it - https://spec.editorconfig.org/.

We can then use =editorconfig-find-current-editorconfig= function to see if the
editorconfig can see our config file.

We can then create a simple .py file:

#+begin_src python :tangle no
  def x(value):
      print(value)
#+end_src

We can see that there are 4 spaces to print statement. We can add such lines in
our .editorconfig file to change that:

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  root = true

  [*]
  indent_style = space
  indent_size = 10
#+end_src

Now do =editorconfig-apply= and after =editorconfig-format-buffer=
function(can probably bind it to a key or do a hook, so it is ran on each save)
and the new changes to inded_size will be applied to your python file:

#+begin_src python :tangle no
  def x(value):
      print(value)
#+end_src

Found this also in the docs(can confirm that it works automatically, yes):

#+begin_quote
Normally, enabling editorconfig-mode should be enough for this plugin to work:
all other configurations are optional. This mode sets up hooks so that
EditorConfig properties will be loaded and applied to the new buffers
automatically when visiting files.
#+end_quote

Finally let's install it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package editorconfig
    :ensure t
    :config
    (editorconfig-mode 1))
#+end_src

** Ace-window

Using denote for my personal knowledge base that will last forever and does not
depend on any close-source tools(Evernote, Onenote, etc). The knowledge base is
made of simply text file, so they won't get corrupted or old/unused overtime.

*** Main denote config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package denote
    :ensure t

    ;; Denote DOES NOT define any key bindings. I just pick some of the bindings
    ;; from "Sample configuration" here - https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote and
    ;; bind them. There are way more available functions in the docs.

More things to include here - https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html
Control visibility - https://orgmode.org/manual/Initial-visibility.html

I specifically wanted to add the "startup" parameter in each new buffer, so
large note files would not spit all the information into my face when I open
that note. Have overview view instead.

Working, but with warnings. So not tangling it on startup and only evaluating
it when I need it. Otherwise, I am getting these warnings:

*** COMMENT Denote journal with a timer

https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote - "Journalling with a timer" part.

Good for Spanish practice.

[[https://github.com/protesilaos/tmr][TMR package]] is needed for this to work

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tmr
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

Create variables and add a hook to denote journal hook.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar my-denote-tmr-duration "10")

  (defvar my-denote-tmr-description "Practice writing in my journal")

  (defun my-denote-tmr ()
    (tmr my-denote-tmr-duration my-denote-tmr-description))

  (add-hook 'denote-journal-extras-hook 'my-denote-tmr)
#+end_src

** Org-mode

I use Org mode extensively.

In buffer settings - https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-Settings.html

*** Org-mode generals

Something for when having images in .org file. Read devnotes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-image-actual-width nil)
#+end_src

Open org links in the same buffer as you are now. Don't like it when I can not
control it and it just opens the link in a random frame.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-link-frame-setup '((file . find-file)))
#+end_src

The deeper you go in the headings, the mode indented it is. Basically makes the
org file to look nicer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-startup-indented t)
#+end_src

Allows to toggle TAB while not on the headline, but when somewhere outside the
headline. Useful for when you want to collapse the headline when deep inside of
its contents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-cycle-emulate-tab 'white)
#+end_src

Pressing RET(enter) follows(opens) a link under cursor
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-return-follows-link t)
#+end_src

Open source block window under the current buffer (C-c ')
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-window-setup `split-window-below)
#+end_src

Rebind active time-stamp to inactive. For some reason I got used to using
inactive timestamps, maybe because they don't show up in agenda.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    (bind-key "C-c ." #'org-time-stamp-inactive org-mode-map))
#+end_src

Change org heading continuation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; (setq org-ellipsis "⏎")
#+end_src

Make the indentation look nicer in org mode. Pull the second level and higher
level headings from the left side.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-indent-mode)
#+end_src

This setting is responsible for the indentation in the src code blocks. If set
to t - will preserve the indentation after you leave the source block. If set
to nil - your code will be indented with two extra spaces. Looks nice, but idk
why one would choose this option(it was my default for a looong time until now,
just figured out this option).

Actually nil is the way to go for me. Otherwise - code is structured strangely
after I close the src block.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-preserve-indentation nil)
#+end_src

Not sure what these two do, but leaving them here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+end_src

*** Org-mode agenda

When a TODO is set to a done state, record a timestamp
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-log-done 'time)
#+end_src

Setting up org-agenda-files using those variables
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-files
      (directory-files-recursively "~/GIT/devnotes/" ".org$"))

  ;; (setq org-agenda-files
  ;;     (directory-files-recursively "~/GIT/devnotes/" ".*agenda.*\\.org$"))
#+end_src

Create a keybinding for org-agenda
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key ag/custom-bindings-map (kbd "C-c a") 'org-agenda)
#+end_src

Set default todo keywords (C-t)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-todo-keywords
  (quote ((sequence "TODO(t)" "PROGRESS(p)" "|" "DONE(d)" "CANCELLED(c)"))))
#+end_src

TODO and DONE keywords already have colors assigned to them, but my newly
created "PROG" - does not. Assigning it here:

To see all the available colors, check =list-faces-display=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
        '(
          ("PROGRESS" . (:foreground "yellow" :weight bold))
          ))
#+end_src

By default when you do 'M-x org-agenda' and you go to todo's or tags or just
the agenda view - you see it like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (agenda  . " %i %-12:c%?-12t% s") ;; file name + org-agenda-entry-type....
#+end_src

For me that is too much information, I don't need to know in which file the
agenda item is, sicne I only have one agenda file. Instead of that information,
I make it as clutter free as possible by overriding everything(those file names
nad etc) to a dot like so:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq org-agenda-prefix-format '(
;;          (agenda  . "  • ")
;;          (timeline  . " • ")
;;          (todo  . " • ")
;;          (tags  . " • ")
;;          (search . " • ")
;;          ))
#+end_src

Hook to display the agenda in a single window by deleting all the
other windows
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook 'delete-other-windows)
#+end_src

Defining custom agenda commands that allow me to reach the tasks that I need.
The same can almost be as quickly achieved by opening org agenda, pressing =m=
and then defining your tag by which to filter. If we count the number of key
presses - they are the same :) Interesting which method I will end up using more.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(
          ;; ("x" agenda)
          ;; ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
          ;; ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
          ;; ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
          ;; ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
          ;; ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ;description for "h" prefix
          ;; ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
          ;; ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
          ;; ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")
          ("p" . "Project searches") ;description for "h" prefix
          ("pi" tags "inbox")
          ("pe" tags "emacs")
          ("pl" tags "lifeapi")
          ("pq" tags "quotes")
          ("pa" tags "arvydasdev")
          ("pp" tags "pagalbagyvunams")
          ("pc" tags "cdp")
          ("ps" tags "smutifruti")
          ("po" tags "obelsdumas")
          ))
#+end_src

*** Org-mode refile

Set org refile targets. Refiling helps me to move headings(content) between or
different org files that I have(in this case, 'org-agenda-files') with "C-w"
command.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-refile-targets '((org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 2)))
#+end_src

*** Org-mode capture

Example of a simple capture template:

Documentation for possible template elements - https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html

Documentation for possible template expansion - https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq org-capture-templates '(("i"	;key
                                 "Inbox"	;description
                                 entry	;type
                                 (file+headline ag/task-file "Inbox") ;target
                                 "* TODO %^{Title}\n:PROPERTIES:\nCAPTURED: %U\nWHERE: %a\nINSERT: %i\n:END:\n\n%?" ;template
                                 ;; :prepend t ; properties(append the new note to the top! BUT resets [/] if you have it setup)
                                 )))
#+end_src

Create a keybinding for org-capture.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key ag/custom-bindings-map (kbd "\C-cc") 'org-capture)
#+end_src

Load capture templates depending on the linux/wsl user
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Get the current username
  (setq current-username (getenv "USER"))

  ;; Check the username and load the appropriate capture templates file
  (if (string= current-username "s2753g")
      (load "~/.emacs.d/s2753g-capture-templates.el")
    (load "~/.emacs.d/default-capture-templates.el"))
#+end_src

Made a personal file for them, so I could load a different capture template
configuration for work and for personal use.

Click =C-cC= to see all the capture templates in sort of graphical view.

*** Org-mode archive

[2023-12-08 Fri] trying not to archive anything.

But if info about archiving is needed, can find it here:

http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/org-archive-location.html

https://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-archive-location

or in my old config -
https://github.com/arvydasg/.emacs.d/tree/20231124-Before-denote

Use internal archiving for all files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-archive-location "::* Archived Tasks")
#+end_src

or can specify for each file individually with:
#+ARCHIVE: ::* Archived Tasks

*** COMMENT org-download

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-download
    :ensure t)

  (setq-default org-download-image-dir "~/GIT/devnotes/media")

  ;; Drag-and-drop to `dired`
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'org-download-enable)
#+end_src


*** COMMENT LaTeX export

Latex config example here - https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs. Did not use
LaTeX much myself.

*** COMMENT Org Modern

Touch up the appearance of org mode files with some fancy UTF-8 characters.
I disable ~org-modern-block-fringe~ due to [[https://github.com/minad/org-modern/issues/144][org-modern conflicting with]]
~org-adapt-indentation~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Modern looks for Org
  (use-package org-modern
    :ensure t
    :after org
    :hook (org-mode . org-modern-mode)
    :config
    (setq org-modern-block-fringe nil))
#+end_src

** Version control

[2021-07-01] “Magit” - can not imagine working with git without
it. Instead of writing full commands like: “git add .” and then “git
commit -m ‘bla blaa’” then “git push”… I can simply =C-x g= for a git
status. Then =s= to do git add. And finally =C-c C-c= to invoke git
commit and simply write a message. Then press =p= and I just pushed
the changes. Way quickier than the termina, believe me.

Some notes:

- install git first on emacs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgLZUYd8Cw
- use personal access token
- add this to terminal to save the token for furher use
- git config –global credential.helper store

Execute the following lines in your terminal before trying to do
any commands with Magit.

git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global user.name arvydasg
git config --global user.email azegaspa@gmail.com

When you push anything, you will get prompted to enter a
password. Enter the ¨personal access token¨ from github developer
settings.

Cool, can see the commands magit is running by going to "magi-process" buffer
in emacs while in git repo

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :bind (("C-x g" . magit-status)
           ("C-x C-g" . magit-status)))
#+end_src

** Completion UI

*** Vertico

[2023-11-26] decided to try out vertico instead of ivy.  Ivy
depends on a lot of packages, vertico is more simple. It also
replaces amx for M-x search. Prot inspired me to try it out. Let's
see.

It is everywhere - Ctrl-x f, M-x, ctrl-x d, ctrl-h v... everywhere
where you are trying to list and jump to something - vertico is
there

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package vertico
    :ensure t
    :init
    (vertico-mode)

    ;; Show more candidates
    (setq vertico-count 10)
    )
#+end_src

*** COMMENT Vertico-postframe

The completions are centered in a posframe (a frame at point). Using posframe
to show Vertico.

But still, some commands that you launch over M-x, like =rgrep= will require
you to look down to finish the command. And I am very very much accustomed to
looking to the bottom left corner.

It also blocks important info in the buffer when I use it.. Swiper still is at
the bottom.. yeah.. this package is not quite there yet.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package vertico-posframe
    :ensure t
    :config
    (vertico-posframe-mode 1)
    (setq vertico-posframe-width 100
    vertico-posframe-height vertico-count))
#+end_src

*** Savehist

Use the built in savehist-mode to prioritize recently used commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package savehist
    :ensure t
    :init
    (savehist-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** Marginalia

With Marginalia, we get better descriptions for commands inline. M-x, C-c f,
C-x b. Adds annotations at the margin of the minibufer for completion
candidates

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package marginalia
    :ensure t
    :config
    (marginalia-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** Completion with corfu

Modular text completion framework for code. Using instead of company package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package corfu
    :ensure t
    :init
    (global-corfu-mode 1)
    (corfu-popupinfo-mode 1)
    (corfu-history-mode)
    :config
    (setq corfu-cycle t
    corfu-auto t
    corfu-auto-delay 0
    corfu-auto-prefix 2
    corfu-popupinfo-delay 0.5))
#+end_src

*** TODO Company

Write benefits and disadvantages to corfu. Have the config ready from the old
config.

*** Orderless

Let's you to type "pa re con" in vertico minubuffer instead of
"package-refresh-contents". Orderless completion.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package orderless
    :ensure t
    :init
    (setq completion-styles '(orderless basic partial-completion)
          completion-category-defaults nil
          orderless-component-separator "[ |]"
          completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion)))))
#+end_src

** Navigation and searching

*** Consult
The package Consult improves navigation and searching.

Consult - a super great package that will improve and make my workflow way more
interesting in emacs. It overrides a lot of default commands, but I am not
angry about it at all, these are just pure improvements.

Consult has lots of functions to keybind to. I looked through them all and
decided to keybind only particular ones. To see more of the functions, find
them in M-x ~consult-~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; (use-package consult
  ;;   :ensure t
  ;;   :bind (:map ag/custom-bindings-map
  ;;               ("C-x b" . consult-buffer)
  ;;               ("C-c m" . consult-man)
  ;;               ("C-c r" . consult-ripgrep)))

  ;; Example configuration for Consult
  (use-package consult
    :ensure t
    ;; Replace bindings. Lazily loaded due by `use-package'.
    :bind (;; C-c bindings in `mode-specific-map'
           ("C-c M-x" . consult-mode-command) ;cool, lists all the various mode commands available in the current buffer
           ("C-c h" . consult-history)
           ("C-c k" . consult-kmacro)
           ("C-c m" . consult-man)
           ("C-c i" . consult-info)

           ([remap Info-search] . consult-info)

Enable dired-find-alternate-file. In new config it always asks at the beginning
to enable this command, since it is disabled. I find it annoying, I always use
“a” to open a folder in dired and I will continue doing so. The piece of code
below does it so that I don’t get prompted “do you really want to use this
command” all the time.

*** Sidebar

**** COMMENT dired-sidebar

Sidebar, does the job, but don't like that ace-window clasifies that sidebar as
a window to possibly jump to. When I have 2 windows open side by
side(+sidebar), I can no longer jump to one of them with =C-x o=. I must choose
to which buffer to jump.. not good.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dired-sidebar
    :hook
    (dired-sidebar-mode-hook . hide-mode-line-mode)
    (dired-sidebar-mode-hook . hl-line-mode)
    (dired-sidebar-mode-hook . variable-pitch-mode)
    (dired-sidebar-mode-hook . init-dired-sidebar))
#+end_src

Could try to ignore that buffer in a similar way, but the sidebar does not have
a name assigned to it..

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  :config
  (add-to-list 'aw-ignored-buffers "*Sidebar*")) ;; Replace "*Sidebar*" with the actual name of the dired-sidebar buffer

*** Session management

You work on many windows and many layouts - then you close emacs. All is lost,
windows are lost, layouts are lost, you can not get them back with
=winner-mode=. This is what session management is. Being able to get back to
those sessions from last closed emacs session.

** Terminal

*** Vterm

Using vterm is like using Gnome Terminal inside Emacs.

To copy from vterm buffer - first enable vterm-copy-mode with C-c C-t. To
deactivate the mode - same command.

=sudo apt install fish libtool libtool-bin autoconf automake cmake g++
libncurses-dev libz-dev libglib2.0-dev (for vterm)=

In case you need to copy something from vterm terminal, use =vterm-copy-mode=
by pressing =C-c C-t=.

** Programming

Good intro for setting up programming language -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAjIoKqbmg8&ab_channel=BrentWestbrookx

*** Set up syntax highlighting with Tree-stitter! For all languages

First of all, do you know which languages you will be using? In my case it's
JavaScript and Python. Let's use the built in tree-sitter to download the
libraries for syntax highlighting(by default js and py files get recognized and
syntax is highlighted, but for other languages(like rust) you will must install
treesit library for syntax highlighting of rust code)

Steps like in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAjIoKqbmg8&ab_channel=BrentWestbrook
1. have git and c compiler installed(gcc or smth else(should be in your nix config already))
2. do =treesit-install-language-grammar= and write javascript, next next next,
   then check the messages buffer if it was really installed "Library installed
   to ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-javascript.so"
3. Do the same for python "Library installed to
   ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-python.so"

*** Devdocs - for all languages

https://github.com/astoff/devdocs.el

Inspiration config - https://github.com/gopar/.emacs.d?tab=readme-ov-file#devdocs

To install docs of a particular language, do =M-x devdocs-install=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package devdocs
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map ag/custom-bindings-map
                 ("C-h D" . devdocs-lookup)))
#+end_src

*** Flymake

This is not a spell check, but code error check.

Mostly useful when having lsp or eglot in the buffer and it lists the errors.

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Flymake.html

Use it when checking for syntax/code errors. =consult-flymake= helps with this.
=M-g f=.

*** Python
**** Inspiration for python development in emacs

- eglot+numpydoc+blacken+poetry https://gist.github.com/Nathan-Furnal/b327f14e861f009c014af36c1790ec49
- jupyter+elpy+flycheck https://realpython.com/emacs-the-best-python-editor/
-

If using elpy together with corfu - you will get double suggestions. Do smth about that.

**** Not having any python specific configuration

Syntax is partyly highlighted, python mode is on when I enter the .py buffer.

Seems like Emacs has SOME python support.

**** Setting up virtual environments

***** Pyvenv
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pyvenv
    :ensure t
    ;; load pyvenv only after one of the commands has been used(reduces emacs
    ;; init time)
    :commands (pyvenv-activate pyvenv-deactivate pyvenv-workon pyvenv-create))
#+end_src

=pyvenv-create=
=pyvenv-workon=
=pyvenv-activate=

Above are some of the commands to work with python virtual environments.

Before doing any of python development work, get into a virtual environment.

In terminal you should be able to see which venv you are in by doing

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  which python
#+end_src

***** COMMENT Pipenv

- Note taken on [2024-01-02 Tue 07:52] \\
  cant figure out how it works, disabling. Sticking with pyvenv.
- Note taken on [2024-01-02 Tue 07:40] \\
  [2024-01-02 Tue] As long as I remember I was using pyvenv. But I will try to
  use pipenv instead of pyvenv because pipenv is "newer"? and it is recommended
  by doom-modeline - https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/issues/109. With
  pyvenv it's not possible to show current env in modeline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package pipenv
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

**** Eglot

Nice intro to eglot:
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQJBvp77WCo&ab_channel=whatacold
 - https://www.adventuresinwhy.com/post/eglot/

NOTE: Eglot does not work with python3.11!!! Install a lower python version.

Using Elpy for python development seems like it's enough, but Elpy its only for
Python. And elpy is no longer maintained.

Since I am not developing ONLY in python, I need something more universal,
something that can handle multiple programming languages.

One option is LSP - https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode. It could be used,
BUT something similar like it is already built in withing Emacs 29 and it's
called Eglot - https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot. Better use something that's
built in, don't you think? Emacs peeps have made a decision to include Eglot
into it's source, so it must be good.

To use Eglot it, simply write =M-x eglot= when in a Python file(or any other
file that you have language server of installed in your system). If it's first
time running eglot, you will get a message that no language server is
installed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'eglot)
#+end_src

***** Eglot virtualenv setup for python

- create a virtual env with =pyvenv-create=
- activate the env with =pyvenv-workon=
- Open terminal(vterm, eshell, shell) and write =which python= and make sure
  you are inside the virtual environment that you have created in previous
  steps
- install language server with =pip install 'python-language-server[all]'=
- pip list to confirm that =pip install 'python-language-server[all]'= was
  properly installed
- open a python file in emacs
- run =M-x eglot=
- Now when you do =M-x eglot= - you it will get connected to the language
  server. AND you will start noticing the errors, warnings and so on.

You will be able to jump to definition now, amazing! Docs will work also.
Warnings/errors all over the place. Seems like it does work.

[2024-01-10 Wed] Previously I would do the method described above to work with
python files. But that is tedious, better make it automatic, like described
here - https://www.adventuresinwhy.com/post/eglot/.

But now it does not know where the language server is. Previously I would
activate venv that has language server, but now we did not.

- create virtual environment anywhere on your machine(with pyvenv or just
  python -m venv), any way. (I prefer the emacs way, so that all of the venvs
  are in ~/.virtualvenvs folder). In my case it is named "base""
- Open terminal(vterm, eshell, shell) and write =which python= and make sure
  you are inside the virtual environment that you have created in previous
  steps
- install language server with =pip install 'python-language-server[all]'=
- pip list to confirm that =pip install 'python-language-server[all]'= was
  properly installed
- create/open ~/.bashrc file
- add the following line to it - =export PATH=$PATH:/home/s2753g/.virtualenvs/base/bin=
- run =source ~/.bashrc= in your wsl/linux terminal
- restart emacs/and/or your wsl also
- do =echo $PATH= and make sure  you see your virtual environment in the path
- open a python file in emacs
- eglot must have started automatically by now, congrats

So no whenever we want some package globally, we install it in the "base"
virtual environment and when we need to activate project specific virtual
environment, we can do that also. Packages will be taken from both the
environments. No more requirements.txt collision.

[2024-01-10 Wed] Don't use python relative paths like from =.utils import bla=.
Better use =app_name.utils import bla=. The second way is recognizable for
elpy.

[2024-01-11 Thu] NOTE that if package is NOT installed globally(in base env)
and installed only in your additional virtual env - eglot will not notice that.
Better install all packages in base env to have a variaty of packages there.
And to launch/build stuff - use virtualenv. NOTE NOTE - actually it will work
if you activate the virtual environment AND then enable eglot in current
buffer(or restart eglot if it already was enabled)

***** Launch Eglot upon opening python file

Since we have virtualenv's setup, we can now safely ask Emacs to launch eglot
when opening python files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
#+end_src

***** Turn on `flyspell-mode' for comments and strings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)
#+end_src

***** Toggle superword movement and editing

 Enabling it changes the definition of words such that characters which have
 symbol syntax are treated as parts of words: e.g., in `superword-mode',
 \"this_is_a_symbol\" counts as one word.

 this_is_a_symbol. With superword mode, when pressing M-f or M-b you will jump
 from t in this to l in symbol. Instead of "this", then "is", then "a"...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'superword-mode)
#+end_src

***** Selectively hide/show code and comment blocks

Strange shortcut for this, but good to know it exists.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode)
#+end_src

if you want to write functions quickier, use yasnippet-snippets. Refer to that
package for instructions.

**** Be able to source python code blocks in org files

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((python . t)))
#+end_src

For example like so:

# By adding :results output to the header arguments of the source block, you
# instruct Org mode to capture the standard output of the code block execution
# and display it as the result.

#+begin_src python :tange no :results output

**** Black formatter on save

- https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html#emacs
- https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-python-black

Make sure black is installed in your virtual environment:

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
  pip install black
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package python-black
    :demand t
    :after python
    :hook (python-mode . python-black-on-save-mode-enable-dwim))
#+end_src

dwmi means "do what I mean".

=python-black-on-save-mode-enable-dwim= uses heuristics to autodetect if a file
should be autoformatted:

- file inside a site-packages/ directory? ➡ do not format
- project not using black? ➡ do not format

in your case the autodetection that your project uses black likely doesn't
work. Having a line like this in =pyproject.toml= should make that work:

#+begin_src toml :tangle no
[tool.black]
#+end_src

It does indeed work then.

- Have virtual env activated
- Have black installed
- Have pyproject.toml with [tool.black]

Black formatter should work in your project.

**** Snippets
for tag completion - using yasnippet snippets
**** COMMENT emmet-mode
- Note taken on [2024-01-10 Wed 14:30] \\
  after installing and reading web-mode docs, realized that web mode also has
  some tag completion help, so might not use emmet for this. Web mode is a must
  for django templates.

[2021-07-01] “Emmet mode” - HTML completion. Click c-j to autocomplete a tag.
Cheat sheet - https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/

SU WEB MODE PRADEDA flycheck nebeveikti ir emmet durniuoja.

[2024-01-10 Wed] enabling it again, should click C-j to expand tag I think.
Using emmet ONLY for tags like p etc, since yasnippet-snippets does not provide
such basic tags.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emmet-mode
    :ensure t
    :config
    :hook ((web-mode . emmet-mode)
           (html-mode . emmet-mode)

           ;; (css-mode . emmet-mode)

  #+end_src

**** web-mode
- Note taken on [2024-01-10 Wed 14:34] \\
  =C-e= in html buffer provides many keybindings.

  Also, for django you can use =C-c C-s= to have a list of snippets! Like if, block ,etc! Nice.

https://web-mode.org/

https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ram6jz/i_need_some_help_on_how_to_use_emacs_for/

Web mode in my case is useful when I want to edit html files, but django(jinja)
style. Web mode has language specific engines, "django" engine is one of them.

    :ensure t)

  ;; enabling web mode for ALL html files
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html\\'" . web-mode))

  ;; all the .html files in these directories will have "django" engine applied
  ;; to them and syntax formatting will work properly
  (setq web-mode-engines-alist
        '(

[2021-07-01] A package that displays the available keybindings in a popup. The
package is pretty useful, as Emacs seems to have more keybindings than I can
remember at any given point. For example press Ctrl+c or Ctrl+x in a buffer and
you will see the possible commands. [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][Which key]] is nice for discoverability.

video. I am kind of too new to programming to be using snippets, but its nice,
keeping this plugin for now. It installs kind of many snippets… hope that
doesn’t slow emacs down. Shouldnt… You can also create your own snippet…
